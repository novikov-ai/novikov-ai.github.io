The brain is the most energy-consuming part of our body. It often deceives us, but why?

The answer is simple: to save us by conserving resources for its complex work.

Clearly, this doesn’t sit well with us, especially since software development is a complex and creative task that demands maximum engagement from everyone involved.

I’m sure many of you are familiar with the concept of asking questions. There’s a saying: “A well-asked question is half the answer.”

But why does this work, and does it really work?

Why ask questions, and how does it help solve problems?

I’m currently taking a course on systems thinking (ST) and gaining a wealth of insights.

In short, ST teaches two things:
1. To see the boundaries of your competence.
2. To view problems on a larger scale.

There’s also the concept of a “model” for solving various tasks. However, in this post, we’ll focus on the idea of “context.”

For now, let’s define context as the environment in which a particular problem exists.

Now, here’s the interesting part: a solution to a problem may exist either in the context you’re currently considering or in a different one.

This is where questions come into play, with the sole purpose of narrowing the scope of the task at hand—essentially establishing the right context in which the answer will exist.

When it seems like there’s no solution, try changing the context you’re working within. Perhaps the answer is simply at a different level.

Remember: by asking the right questions, we place our brains within the necessary framework to solve the task.

This happens to me all the time. But have you ever found yourself wanting to ask a question to your colleagues, only to discover the answer on your own while formulating the question?
