Many developers, when transitioning to Go, start looking for an easy and convenient way to work with databases. It‚Äôs normal ‚Äì developers get used to tools that make their lives easier.

When I was writing in C#, I used [Entity Framework Core](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore) ‚Äì the ORM for the .NET platform. Since it was my first language, I thought this was the natural way to work, and I never really considered alternatives (maybe there weren‚Äôt any on .NET at the time, and I‚Äôm not sure if there are now).

In Go, there‚Äôs the standard database/sql library, which provides a common interface for working with SQL-like databases. If you need maximum performance, this is your go-to choice.

However, in large, serious projects, maintaining a big codebase becomes more important, and that means ease of use and maintainability come first.

### SQLX

When the standard library starts feeling limiting, [sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx) comes to the rescue, extending the possibilities while keeping performance intact.

Last month, our team faced the challenge of finding a more convenient way to work with the database, after struggling a bit with raw sqlx in the past. We decided to seriously consider using an ORM, and Go certainly has its fair share of options.

When I first started learning Go, one of the early lessons I picked up was that using an ORM is considered bad practice. I held onto that belief until ease of use became a bigger priority than performance.

After some team discussions that led to no solid consensus, I reached out to the internal Go community for advice. Colleagues unanimously tore apart ORMs, and we discussed alternatives ü§ì

One library that caught my eye was Squirrel, which helps generate SQL queries. I decided to give it a spin in a real-world scenario.

Surprisingly, the perfect task came up almost immediately. I needed to batch-save multiple items into a table, since performing multiple inserts would be a luxury we couldn‚Äôt afford in a high-load project.

The task seemed straightforward, but there was a catch. The number of items to save could vary widely, meaning I needed a ‚Äúhack‚Äù to construct a rather bulky query.

### Composing sql-queries

That‚Äôs where [Squirrel](https://github.com/Masterminds/squirrel) came in handy. Using its various builders, I could construct complex queries.

We initialize a builder and populate it with data.

**Important!** Don‚Äôt forget to choose the correct placeholder format depending on the database driver! For Postgres, it‚Äôs the dollar sign.

~~~go
builder := squirrel.Insert("element").Columns("title", "price")

for _, element := range elements {
  builder = builder.Values(
    element.Title, element.Price)
}

query, args, err := builder.PlaceholderFormat(squirrel.Dollar).ToSql()
if err != nil {
  return fmt.Errorf("failed to build query: %w", err)
}

_, err = tx.Exec(query, args...)
if err != nil {
  return fmt.Errorf("failed to execute query: %w", err)
}
~~~

In the end, we get the query we need:

~~~sql
INSERT INTO element (title, price) VALUES ($1, $2), ($3, $4)
~~~

Of course, it would be interesting to look at various performance tests with and without this library (I might do some benchmarks in the future), but for now, it seems like a great tool when you‚Äôve outgrown sqlx but aren‚Äôt ready to dive into a full ORM just yet.
