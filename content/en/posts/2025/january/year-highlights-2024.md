## Goal Setting with OKRs

Last year, I decided to [try](https://t.me/time2code/243) setting annual goals using the OKR method.

I had [four](https://t.me/time2code/244) ambitious goals, and here's how I performed on the key results for each:

1. 0.68 out of 1.00 üü°  
2. 0.00 out of 1.00 üî¥  
3. 1.00 out of 1.00 üü¢  
4. 0.90 out of 1.00 üü°

Just a reminder: a score between 0.6‚Äì0.7 means a great result because fully achieving an OKR indicates the goal wasn't ambitious enough.

However, one goal didn‚Äôt make much progress at all. That means it‚Äôs time to rethink it: either I overcommitted or the goal wasn‚Äôt relevant enough for me.

You can check the final status of all my goals and key results on my [Notion page](https://time2code.notion.site/1533c4d299554a5ba4e79b79a728becc?v=3cc03bfd9a1048fdbcc6d625dc393ab8).

Clearly, the system has its pros and cons. Let‚Äôs break down the ones I encountered.

### Downsides

1. **Lack of Focus**

Unlike setting a single global "epic" or goal (as I did in 2023 [here](https://t.me/time2code/153)), this time I had several ambitious goals. 

Since there was no clear priority for each one (despite the seemingly obvious sorting order), my focus was scattered.

The obvious takeaway: **prioritize** your **goals** if you have multiple. You can use a simple system like P0, P1, P2 ... Pn (where 0 is the highest priority).

2. **Vague Formulation**

One of my goals was "Increase my grade to E5...", but it‚Äôs doubtful that achieving each key result would have guaranteed the promotion.

So, it‚Äôs important to validate: do the key results actually help achieve the objective?

### Upsides

1. **Roadmap**

Having a structure outlining what I needed to achieve by the end of the year helped me stay on track and not slack off.

Whenever I felt like procrastinating, I would open my goal spreadsheet and look for something I could do right now with minimal effort, which helped.

In fact, by creating OKRs and storing them in a convenient place, you provide yourself with a beacon to stay on course.

2. **Alternatives**

Although having multiple goals can lead to scattered focus, it also gives you the flexibility to switch to another goal when you get stuck on one. Instead of reworking your single goal, you can tackle another clear one and come back to the original when time allows.

Looking back on my experiment with OKR goal setting, I definitely see more pros than cons. So, following my own recommendations, I plan to stick with this system for 2025.
