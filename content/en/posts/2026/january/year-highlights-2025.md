## OKR Methodology

For the second year in a row, I set annual goals using [OKR](https://t.me/time2code/243).

I had [4 ambitious goals](https://t.me/time2code/334), each with its own priority.

Strict **prioritization** of goals is something I decided to try in 2025. And it worked well: I focused on achieving the highest priority, deliberately leaving everything else in the background.

So, let’s take a look at the results.

## Results

### ✅ P0 — Achieving the Next Grade

The most important goal—the one I had been working toward all year—was **achieved**!

It required significantly more effort than I initially expected and seriously impacted progress on other goals. However, since this was my top priority, I kept full focus on it, consciously ignoring everything else.

You can read more about how I achieved this goal and how much time it took me to grow into a Senior role in Big Tech in this [post](https://t.me/time2code/367).

### ❌ P1 — Developing Strong Thinking

SRE school, a frontend architecture course, and DevOps best practices did not receive enough attention this year.

Of course, I continued to develop my thinking, but it did not make it into my OKRs.

### ❌ P2 — Strengthening the Brand

The channel audience grew **organically** by only **25%**. Instead of the target 300 subscribers by the end of the year, I had 184.

Previously, I thought that publishing an article on Habr or VC would help me gain visibility and attract a larger audience. Over time, I realized that chasing numbers is rather pointless, so I am changing my strategy here.

I also dropped the LinkedIn Challenge on my own after two months. I realized it was not for me. I did not like the posts I had to write to “fit” the platform’s style, and I did not have enough energy for a different approach.

Migrating the blog to my own domain was another idea. At the beginning of last year, I was even ready to buy a domain, considered various options, and looked for a new server for migration. However, since I am very satisfied with my Hugo-based blog running on GitHub Pages (I described in detail [how I launched it and what challenges I faced](https://t.me/time2code/306)), I decided not to change anything for now.

“If it works, don’t touch it.”

### ❌ P3 — Mathematics

To be honest, from the very beginning I did not really believe I would be able to complete this OKR. I simply like mathematics and really want to spend time on it when there is an opportunity—but apparently not in 2025.
